# Project Title

React Gallery App

## Getting Started
Utilizing React, this project creates a gallery that allows you to search for images.

In the terminal, use `npm run dev` to initialize the app.

### Extras

- Loading message appears when image results are being fetched.
- Message appears when no results are returned from the search.
- Page not found message appears when route does not exist.
- User can use back and forward arrows on the browser, and the results will update accordingly.
- User can also directly change the `/search/term` path, and results will display accordingly.
